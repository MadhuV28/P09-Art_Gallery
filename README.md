# P09-Art_Gallery
This assignment involves the implementation of an online art gallery using Binary Search Trees
(BST). An art gallery is a place in which visual arts are displayed. It represents a meeting point
for art lovers where one can explore and sometimes purchase artwork by emerging, established
or master artists.
Our BST will store a set of visual artwork objects. Art lovers can visit and explore the art
gallery and lookup for a specific artwork. They can also purchase a specific artwork. The
lookup key information for the retrieval or search operation combines the year of creation of
the artwork and its name. You are going to learn how BSTs can be used to facilitate insertion
and retrieval operations to and from a collection of ordered elements in an easy and elegant
way.
The goals of this assignment include:
• Implement common Binary Search Tree (BST) operations.
• Further developing your experience in recursive problem-solving.
• Improve your experience in developing unit tests.
The Source code can be found inside the 'P09/src' directory.
